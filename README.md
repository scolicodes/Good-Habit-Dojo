# Good-Habit-Dojo
 
Inspired by the Taekwondo belt ranking system, this program rewards users' discipline in sticking to their chosen good habit(s) with colored belt promotions. It is a habit tracker program where the user can enter the day they began their good habit and see what belt they are currently on and how many days are left until their next belt promotion.

As a former martial arts practitioner, I understand the value of this belt system for sticking to goals. One day, it hit me that applying this system to habit tracking could be pretty helpful.

This program is currently a prototype/rough idea.
